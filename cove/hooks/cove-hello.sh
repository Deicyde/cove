# SessionStart hook: tells an agent that starts inside a Cove termling what it
# may do there. Informational only -- it asks for nothing at startup. The user
# owns the Cove's layout and focus; agents describe themselves and keep their
# own notes. Only fires inside the cove ($COVE, set by cove/dev.sh / run.sh).

MSG="You're running inside a Cove termling (session ${SESS}): your terminal is one of
several on the user's board. The user arranges the board and decides focus; you
never move the user's termlings or change focus. The 'cove' MCP tools, for when they help:
- status(state, summary): needs_you / blocked / done badges your termling and
  queues you for the user's attention; working clears it. (The Stop/Notification
  hooks already ping when you finish or wait for input.)
- rename(name): name your own termling. join_frame(frame) / leave_frame(): put
  yourself in (or out of) a frame on the board.
- add_note / update_note / link / delete_notes: your own notes, todo lists and
  arrows on the board, placed next to you.
- whoami, list_terminals, board, find: look around (read-only).
- spawn / send / read / wait / kill / place, add_frame, screenshot: orchestrate
  child agents as termlings you own (see the cove and iterate-pr skills).
  If you were spawned by another agent (whoami 'parent'), report() to it.
Nothing is required at startup."
